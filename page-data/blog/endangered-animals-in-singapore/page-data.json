Cinnamon Bush Frog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Status:&nbsp;</em></strong>Vulnerable</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SELECTED-Cinnamon-Bush-Frog-_-Max-Khoo-NParks.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031\"/><figcaption>This small arboreal frog is usually more heard than seen in the forest.<br><em>©Max Khoo/ NParks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frog species is impacted by the destruction and degradation of forest habitats and is confined mainly&nbsp;to the Central Catchment Nature Reserve and the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Efforts:</em></strong> In Singapore, research on its ecology and translocation efforts are currently being undertaken by NParks as part of a species recovery effort. Singapore’s mature forest habitats are also monitored and conserved to safeguard this species.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Harlequin Butterfly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Status:</em></strong>&nbsp;Endangered</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SELECTED-Harlequin-Butterfly-_-Max-Khoo-NParks3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033\"/><figcaption>Beautiful but very rare in Singapore, its survival depends on the availability of host plants.<br><em>©Max Khoo/ NParks</em><br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Harlequin is a shade-loving jungle butterfly. It is impacted by the destruction and degradation of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/haze/2016/05/forests-stop-burning-start-planting/\">forest habitats</a></span> – one of the major threats to biodiversity globally.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small population of Harlequin butterflies are known to persist in one forested area in Singapore’s western region, with rare sightings of individuals in other forested areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Efforts:</em>&nbsp;</strong>In Singapore, ex-situ breeding and reintroduction efforts are currently being undertaken by NParks and the ButterflyCircle as part of a species recovery effort for the Harlequin butterfly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the rest of Southeast Asia, WWF’s work to halt land conversion while restoring forests is key to protecting the habitats of such forest-dwelling species.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Neptune’s Cup Sponge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Status:</em></strong>&nbsp;Unknown</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SELECTED-Neptune’s-Cup-Sponge-_-Karenne-Tun-NParks-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034\"/><figcaption>A century after it was thought to be extinct, the Neptune’s cup sponge was rediscovered in 2011, in the waters of Singapore.<br><em>©Karenne Tun/ NParks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These goblet-shaped sponges can grow to a large size. In the past, the sponge was harvested by people for museums and private collections, as well as some who used its cup-like structure as babies’ bathtubs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Efforts:&nbsp;</em></strong>Five&nbsp;Neptune’s cup sponges have been transplanted to the Sisters’ Islands Marine Park. Coupled with efforts to propagate the sponge, these measures help safeguard the species and increase reproduction opportunities. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. Straw-Headed Bulbul</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Status:</em></strong>&nbsp;Endangered</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SELECTED-Straw-headed-Bulbul-_-Mendis-Tan-NParks.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035\" width=\"816\" height=\"1232\"/><figcaption>Poaching for the pet bird trade has decimated many species (including the straw-headed bulbul above) across Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia.<br><em>©Mendis Tan/ NParks</em><br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest victims of poaching: the melodious-voiced straw-headed bulbul, which has gone extinct from Thailand and most parts of Indonesia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related: </em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wildlife/2018/10/wwfinsider-in-1-minute-this-rare-bird-on-chinas-shopping-cart/\"><em>This rare bird is on China&#8217;s shopping cart</em></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Efforts: </em></strong>Singapore is a global stronghold for this endangered songbird. The nature reserves in which this species is found are currently protected. To further enhance its conservation, other habitats such as parklands are being enhanced and connected with the nature reserves through multi-tiered planting of streetscapes and park connectors.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regionally, cracking down on Southeast Asia’s illegal bird trade will protect this species from overexploitation.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Smooth-Coated Otter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Status:&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;Critically Endangered</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SELECTED-Otter-_-Tan-Yong-Lin-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3066\"/><figcaption>Charismatic and photogenic, the smooth-coated otter has made a strong comeback in Singapore’s waterways.<br><em>©Tan Yong Lin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wildlife/2018/10/wwf-insider-singapores-otterly-cute-animal-in-grave-danger/\">Everywhere else in Southeast Asia, otters are in greater danger</a></span>&nbsp;due to habitat loss, pollution and poaching for the illegal pet trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conservation Efforts:</em>&nbsp;</strong>There is a collective, multi-disciplinary approach towards otter conservation, with the involvement of NParks and the Otter Working Group. With local communities, the group monitors otter populations and movement in Singapore to resolve issues and protect the species. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to know the remaining 5 most threatened species in Singapore?
