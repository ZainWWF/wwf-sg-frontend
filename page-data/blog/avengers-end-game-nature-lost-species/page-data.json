Unsurprising, given that the reality playing out around us almost feels like an apocalyptic movie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151770\">Here’s what the statistics tell us: our natural\nlandscapes have been significantly changed by the impact of human activities. <strong>75%</strong> of our land, <strong>66%</strong> of our seas and <strong>50%</strong>\nof inland waterways affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151777\">As a result,\naround <strong>1 million</strong> animal and\nplant species are now threatened with extinction within decades &#8211; more than\never before in human history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151782\">We are seeing the highest rate of species extinctions\never recorded, surpassing the extinction of dinosaurs in the Ice Age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151786\">This reads like a movie screenplay. The only difference is that when it plays out in real-life, <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/ocean/2018/11/plastic-pollution-opinion-businesses-pact/\">we are the bad guys</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151793\">Nature is facing its own Thanos: us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size editorskit-42218151801\"><strong>The Age of\nHumans</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151812\">There is a term for this armageddon-like event that humans have inflicted on the natural world, and scientists call it the <em>Anthropocene</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151818\">This signifies a new geological epoch where, for the\nfirst time in Earth’s history a single species – <em>Homo sapiens</em> – has had such a powerful impact on the planet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151825\">Since the 1900s we have been exploiting our natural resources and abusing the use of our lands and seas. <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/sustainable-consumption/2018/10/how-planet-friendly-is-your-favourite-hawker-food/\">A third of all land on Earth has converted to agriculture</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/ocean/2019/05/bluefin-tuna-japan-expert-overfishing/\">90% of our oceans have been fished to or above their limits</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151829\">We have almost single-handedly created climate change and to this very day, continue to <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/ocean/2018/11/beached-whale-plastic-pollution-wakatobi-indonesia/\">pollute nature with mismanaged waste, plastics and toxins</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151836\">Let’s be honest though. These activities have made us rich.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151843\">Since the Industrial Revolution, the global economy has grown 30-fold. The lives of billions of people have improved. We’ve eradicated small pox. Poverty is at an all-time low. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151849\">But here&#8217;s a plot twist: Nature has been footing the bill for us all along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151858\">The Northern white rhino went functionally extinct last\nyear with the death of its last male. Last month, the last female Yangtze giant\nsoftshell turtle died. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151862\">These species are an integral part of a life support system that feeds our economies and protects human health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151868\">Our wetlands filter water that we drink, our forests\nsoak up carbon dioxide, and our coral reefs provide fish as a food source. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151873\">In total, nature provides services worth around <strong>US$125 trillion </strong>a year, over five times the size of the world’s largest economy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151878\">We stand to lose all of this – along with a million plant and animal species – in our lifetime if this continues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size editorskit-42218151886\"><strong>A New Deal That’s\nActually A Big Deal</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151890\">Along with these findings, 600 renowned scientists, wildlife experts and public figures across the globe have issued an <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/call4nature\">open letter to world leaders</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151895\">Their letter makes clear two things: Firstly, there <em>is</em> an action plan and it comes in the form of a few global decisions due to be made on biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development. Secondly, leaders have a deadline to do this in 2020 – that’s less than a year to go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151900\">This action plan is better known as the “New Deal for Nature and People”.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151904\">Don’t just take it from me though. Leo himself has said it: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter editorskit-42218151908\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s time for a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GlobalDealForNature?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GlobalDealForNature</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/wCR3sAdEbX\">https://t.co/wCR3sAdEbX</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPBES7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IPBES7</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aQr8sk1AOu\">pic.twitter.com/aQr8sk1AOu</a></p>&mdash; Leonardo DiCaprio (@LeoDiCaprio) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeoDiCaprio/status/1125852070559539200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 7, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size editorskit-42218151911\"><strong>How Will We Respond?</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151915\">Some prominent voices have spoken up, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-biodiversity-macron/frances-macron-seeks-new-measures-to-protect-biodiversity-idUSKCN1SC1Z2\">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, and a personal favourite, New York congresswoman AOC. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter editorskit-42218151919\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am very alarmed by the latest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IPBES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@IPBES</a> report.

There is no overnight solution, but we certainly can reverse the loss of nature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151942\">The same scientists that delivered the bad news have also provided us with a really clear plan for what needs to be done: We need to completely transform the way we produce and consume our food and energy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151946\">In plain words, this means ensuring that our food systems are\nsustainable and regulated; our water sources managed and protected; our forests\nleft standing and restored, and our oceans well-governed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151950\">At the moment, <em>none</em> of the above is happening. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151955\">Not without some real action from our government leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42218151958\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://voicefortheplanet.org/\">Add your voice</a> to the global call for urgent action.
