Nature not only provides us with all the things we need to live &#8211; the air we breathe and the water we drink, to the economy we rely on &#8211; but also makes our lives better. Its growing loss puts this all under threat. <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/climate-change/2017/03/5-uniquely-singaporean-things-to-do-during-earth-hour/\">Earth Hour</a> will always be a moment where we stop and reflect on our relationship with nature.
