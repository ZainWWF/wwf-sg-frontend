Here, his honest take on Southeast Asia’s role in stopping it.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>LATEST UPDATE: The last female Sumatran rhino Iman died of cancer on Saturday morning (23 Nov) &#8211; just five months after the last male of the species passed on in May.

Or maybe you’ve seen the many recent news articles about the ‘biodiversity extinction crisis’ or the ‘<a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/5/e1400253?utm_source=pulsenews&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">6</a><sup><a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/5/e1400253?utm_source=pulsenews&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">th</a></sup><a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/5/e1400253?utm_source=pulsenews&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\"> mass extinction</a>’, or you want to know why thousands of school children across the globe are going on strike for planetary health, and in trying to find out more you landed here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-430103330400\">Let’s get one thing cleared up – biodiversity, nature, wildlife, call it what you will is in rapid decline across the whole planet. The&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ipbes.net/news/ipbes-global-assessment-preview\" target=\"_blank\">recent report</a>&nbsp;by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)&nbsp;makes this very clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-430103330374\">So do the thousands of scientific journal papers that are reporting species loss, population declines, habitat destruction, and chronic overfishing across the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-4291355379\">A walk through a silent forest, peering into a bleached coral reef, a night-time drive through a countryside emptied of flying insects. You might also come across articles written by commentators who are distinctly unqualified in this area, but who <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/05/the-uns-extinction-warning-doesnt-add-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">claim that biodiversity is not declining</a>—it’s a comforting thought in difficult times, but alas for us all, they’re wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42913553261\">Many scientists, including the 450 or so who wrote the IPBES report, say that lots of the species we are losing haven’t even been discovered (by people that is) and named yet! Their extinctions are predicted on the confirmed declines and extinctions of species that we DO know about. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42914457600\">Does that really matter? How are we going to miss them if we don’t know them?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"editorskit-429165155552\"><strong>Just leave nature and wildlife alone</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42913553265\">Well, each and every one us is dependent on nature, whether we realise it or not, and losing it means losing the many benefits it brings. Nature comprises the food we eat (it even has its own name, agrobiodiversity), purifies our water, pollinates our crops, eats our agricultural pests, forms soil for crops to grow in, is the fish we eat, maintains our climate, and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2016.1221126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">makes us feel good</a>. All for free…and all we have to do is not destroy it. But destroying it we most certainly are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42913553269\">But what does extinction actually look like? Yesterday we heard the news that the <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/?347692/Tam---the-last-male-Sumatran-rhino-in-Sabah-dies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">last male Sumatran rhinoceros in Malaysia has died</a> in Sabah.

Our hearts are filled with sadness as we mourn not only the loss of a wildlife but the loss of a species. With Tam gone, we now only have Iman left, our last female rhino. If we are not careful, the Sumatran rhino will not be the only species that will go extinct under our watch. Our other prized wildlife like elephants, pangolins, bantengs and clouded leopards will also likely meet the same fate if we don&#39;t protect them now.  Let the loss of Tam be the wakeup call that we need to spring into action. Our wildlife needs protection now and like it or not, we are their only hope. #sumatranrhino #sabah #STCP #wildlife #conservation Photo: (c) Raymond Alfred/WWF-Malaysia</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wwfmy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> WWF-Malaysia</a> (@wwfmy) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-05-27T07:59:05+00:00\">May 27, 2019 at 12:59am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42913553273\">What it means is that here is a species that used to live throughout much of Southeast Asia but has now become restricted to tiny, imperiled fragments of its <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280775009_Will_current_conservation_responses_save_the_Critically_Endangered_Sumatran_rhinoceros_Dicerorhinus_sumatrensis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">former range</a> and captive populations.

While we are overexploiting nature to its limits, how much longer can we support the rapid population growth from 2019 to beyond?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42915526918\">With an issue most of us are familiar with (read: waste and plastic pollution) – five of the top ten contributors of global marine plastic debris are Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"editorskit-42916537229\"><strong>Serious lack of funding to protect the planet&#8217;s richest biodiversity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42913553300\">So, with all of this, why is Southeast Asia often overlooked in discussions, policies and funding about the most important areas for conservation? Malaysia was ranked in the top 10 and Indonesia in the top 40 of the most underfunded countries in the world for biodiversity conservation relative to conservation needs. In addition, the effectiveness of protected areas in the region for actually conserving biodiversity is repeatedly being questioned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42913553305\">The lack of funds translates to limited research that could lead to better government policies, responsible business practices. Southeast Asia is <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002413&amp;type=printable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">poorly represented in biodiversity research</a> science publications, despite the region supporting high biodiversity that is under threat. Moreover, regional governments have placed biodiversity research in low priority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-430104546626\">Under current rates of decline, it is anticipated that many species will become extinct in the region.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42913553308\">The solutions are as many as the threats, but among these need to be i) a rethink of how conservation funds are prioritised to regions of high biodiversity and critical threats, ii) policy change and increased enforcement for illegal land clearing and poaching and illegal wildlife trade, and iii) fundamentally raising the profile of biodiversity and alerting all stakeholders (governments, businesses, the general public, the media) to its importance, uniqueness and the benefits that it provides to us all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42913553312\">As you’re reading this, I’ll assume that you already care about nature and wildlife. Under current rates of decline, it is anticipated that many species will become extinct in the region. But the clock is ticking, we all have to act and there is no time to waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-429151220685\"><strong><em>If you like reading this, find out </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/forest/2019/03/haze-singapore-forest-fires-smoke-wwf/\"><strong><em>why the haze could be much worse it is</em></strong></a><strong><em>,  </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/endangered-species/2019/02/asian-elephant-wild-eastern-thailand/\"><strong><em>how collaring wild elephants could save their lives</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and how we </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wildlife/2018/10/golden-triangle-don-sao-market-wwf-singapore/\"><strong><em>helped disrupt wildlife crime by closing down 4 Golden Triangle shops in Asia</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>\n","uri":"sumatran-rhino-southeast-asia-conservation/","author":{"name":"Simon Attwood","slug":"sjattwood","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c6abbbe4c5f1a21f246060f046c7372e?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"featuredImage":{"altText":"","srcSet":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Small_WW22346.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Small_WW22346-300x200.jpg 300w"},"tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"illegal logging","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/illegal-logging/","slug":"illegal-logging"},{"name":"illegal wildlife trade","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/illegal-wildlife-trade/","slug":"illegal-wildlife-trade"},{"name":"IPBES report","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/ipbes-report/","slug":"ipbes-report"},{"name":"marine plastic pollution","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/marine-plastic-pollution/","slug":"marine-plastic-pollution"},{"name":"marine protected areas","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/marine-protected-areas/","slug":"marine-protected-areas"},{"name":"mass extinction","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/mass-extinction/","slug":"mass-extinction"},{"name":"southeast asia","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/southeast-asia/","slug":"southeast-asia"},{"name":"sumatran rhino","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/sumatran-rhino/","slug":"sumatran-rhino"}]},"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Endangered Species","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/endangered-species/","slug":"endangered-species"}]},"campaigns":{"nodes":[]}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDo0ODkx","uri":"sumatran-rhino-southeast-asia-conservation/","title":"How Did We Fail to Save the Last Male Sumatran Rhino in Malaysia?","databaseId":4891,"slug":"sumatran-rhino-southeast-asia-conservation","excerpt":"<p>&#8220;This is what an extinction crisis looks like,&#8221; says Dr Simon Attwood, Conservation Head at WWF-Singapore.
