But as we docked at the shores of Barangay Nagasagan in Masbate, the reality was very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-5-with-logo-jpeg.jpg\" alt=\"image-5-with-logo-jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-2023\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-5-with-logo-jpeg.jpg 650w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-5-with-logo-jpeg-300x190.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A daily view of the fishermen out at sea in the wee hours of the morning</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was greeted by the loving and kind smile of Neice Lateda. Despite our language barrier, I felt her anxiety over the future of her children and grandchildren.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-4-with-logo-jpeg.jpg\" alt=\"image-4-with-logo-jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-2022\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-4-with-logo-jpeg.jpg 650w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-4-with-logo-jpeg-300x190.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Necie looking on her grandchildren playing in the sand</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the stay, we managed to speak to her son, Arnel, to learn more about his life and the impact of climate change on him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the sole breadwinner, Arnel spends his nights out at sea hoping to have enough catch to put food on the table. Beneath his kind face was a man who constantly worried about the future of his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-6-with-logo-jpeg.jpg\" alt=\"image-6-with-logo-jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-2024\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-6-with-logo-jpeg.jpg 650w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-6-with-logo-jpeg-300x190.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arnel Letada with his family</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dwindling fish stocks and climate change have drastically reduced his earnings as a fisherman. More than three-quarters of his earnings, averaging S$4 per day, is spent on drinking water, kerosene and petrol for his boat. Whatever is left is spent on buying one kilogram of rice. This leaves little to set aside for emergencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked if there is enough to feed his family three square meals a day, he only laughed while saying that it will be lucky if they can do just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arnel’s situation is not unique. Numerous families in this region now face the same predicament.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Climate change is happening and our poorest are hardest hit. According to the World Bank, the effects are set to push another <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/11/08/rapid-climate-informed-development-needed-to-keep-climate-change-from-pushing-more-than-100-million-people-into-poverty-by-2030\">100 million people into poverty by 2030</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Escaping poverty will be even harder for communities with little or no climate resilience, as they would have little resources to recover from shocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fishermen like Arnel, their livelihoods will be disrupted if there is a sudden storm. At WWF-Singapore, we aim to build climate resilience for 75 households and 450 people living in this region.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-2-with-logo-jpeg.jpg\" alt=\"image-2-with-logo-jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-2020\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-2-with-logo-jpeg.jpg 650w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-2-with-logo-jpeg-300x190.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A villager fetching water from a nearby village in their boat</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With provision for container farming, rainwater harvesting and solar lighting, the Letada family can reduce recurring costs and shift their expenditure to critical household needs and provide education for their children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we left the sitio, I gave Necie a hug and I gave her my word that we will come back and help her family and community.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-7-with-logo-jpeg.jpg\" alt=\"image-7-with-logo-jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-2025\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-7-with-logo-jpeg.jpg 650w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Image-7-with-logo-jpeg-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Necie sobbing during our chat about her hopes and dreams for her grandchildren</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impacts of climate change are real and it is happening around us.
