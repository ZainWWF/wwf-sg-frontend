The expansive greenery is a sight to behold and makes for a wonderful background in our chat with <strong>Kyle Lek, a young and jolly man of 23, who has pledged to run 10 km a day everyday for a whole year to raise awareness about WWF and nature.</strong> He has <strong>successfully completed 100 consecutive days of running</strong> today; that&#8217;s simply amazing!</p>\n<p>So what started it all? &#8220;I have always believed in wildlife and nature &#8211; both of them work alongside each other. Coming from a mountaineering background, when you see Mother Nature as a whole, you get really touched and make a connection with yourself and nature,&#8221; he says. He was also inspired to do this for his girlfriend, who loves wildlife and helps him take his pictures for his photo journal on his social media channels!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1921\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1921\" style=\"width: 975px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1921 size-large\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kyle2-©-WWF-Singapore-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle at MacRitchie Reservoir\" width=\"975\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kyle2-©-WWF-Singapore-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kyle2-©-WWF-Singapore-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kyle at MacRitchie Reservoir © WWF-Singapore</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>What Keeps Kyle Going?</h2>\n<p>When asked why 10 km and that too everyday, he replies with a simple, &#8220;I am doing what I love and I want to channel that&nbsp;for a greater cause.&#8221; Kyle strongly believes in doable challenges;&nbsp;the magnitude of this will multiply supporters over time. And guess what, <strong>he&#8217;s not missed a single day so far!</strong> How has he achieved this?!</p>\n<p>&#8220;I follow this motto from my mentor, Khoo Swee Chiow -&#8216;If the mind is willing, the body will adapt&#8217;. It&#8217;s about self-improvement; and if I can do this everyday, people can do it too. I also want people to understand the importance of immersing themselves in nature and wildlife. And I have taken up a responsibility so I will keep it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not always as simple as that; Kyle admits his challenge is time management. &#8220;I used to plan too much &#8211; as a full-time working person and having to meet family and friends. The run is not just the running time alone. It&#8217;s also the travel to places to run. Even though it&#8217;s raining or I have just had lunch, I still have to run, but I&#8217;ll pace myself to go slower. So it&#8217;s a lot about managing time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And what about when he is sick? &#8220;Those days are terrible because I procrastinate,&#8221; he smiles. &#8220;But it&#8217;s funny &#8211; when you&#8217;re sick and you go for a run, you feel crappy at the start. But halfway through, the body seems to adapt!&#8221;&nbsp;Doesn&#8217;t all the&nbsp;running take a toll on his health? &#8220;Recovery and being able to keep myself fit for the next day is an important challenge,&#8221; he acknowledges. Having lost 12 kg since he&#8217;s started running, he needs to especially be careful about his knees and maintain his health.</p>\n<h2>Most Memorable Running&nbsp;Days</h2>\n<p>&#8220;I enjoy when I run alone&nbsp;and am really immersed in it&nbsp;even though there&#8217;s music playing in my ears. Also&nbsp;when people go running with me, this has more impact than when running by myself.&#8221; <strong>He recently hit his personal best too:&nbsp;44 minutes 14 seconds!</strong></p>\n<p>He also has a strange and interesting story to share. &#8220;I was running near Punggol waterway, and there is only one direction&nbsp;to run. I remember overtaking 2 ladies who were walking slowly. A while later ahead,&nbsp;I passed them&nbsp;again! How did that happen? Did they teleport?!&#8221; Maybe they were actually different ladies, I suggest. He shakes his head. &#8220;I can remember their clothing. Runs can get boring and so I tend to observe things more,&#8221; he answers. The story gets weirder. &#8220;I expected to see them when I turned back but&nbsp;didn&#8217;t! I ran up and down again but didn&#8217;t see them!&#8221;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1922\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1922\" style=\"width: 975px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1922 size-large\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kyle1-©-Patcha-Chol-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle1-©-Patcha-Chol\" width=\"975\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kyle1-©-Patcha-Chol-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kyle1-©-Patcha-Chol-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1922\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">© Patcha Chol</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>\n<p>I ask him what he expects out of this chapter of his life. &#8220;The objective is to raise awareness and funds for WWF but it also is to promote and maintain a healthy lifestyle. My personal aim is to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to make 10 km running a natural part of my life, just like brushing my&nbsp;teeth! This will help my passion for mountaineering and other sports.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For his next 100 days, he&#8217;s planning to continue raising awareness for MacRitchie (where a planned development project could affect the diversity) and run wherever he is&nbsp;when he goes on mountaineering expeditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Hats off to your dedication, Kyle! We are really inspired!
