For the wild elephants, the Eastern Forest Complex has been their home for the past four centuries.

In fact, the DNP team was following the elephants&#8217; behaviour for sometime before they narrowed down to one elephant from the group. One characteristic they look out for: it needs to be a leader and have peers. This ensures that the selected one can represent the movements of a group after installation of collar. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the elephants can be too big or aggressive to be collared.
