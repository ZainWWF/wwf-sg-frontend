Over half the world&#8217;s forest are already gone and if we continue &#8211; &nbsp;business as usual &#8211; &nbsp;and do nothing about this, then forest loss is predicted to reach an incredible <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/_core/general.cfc?method=getOriginalImage&amp;uImgID=%26%2AR%20-%20%2E%27%3F%0A\">232 million hectares</a>. Here are five reason why we should get planting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. &nbsp;FOrests are THE EARTH&#8217;S LUNGS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Forests take in carbon dioxide and &#8216;exhale&#8217; oxygen. This may be a complex biological process, but it doesn&#8217;t take a genius to figure out that it is rather important for us oxygen-breathing beings. Saving forest means saving clean breathable air. Equally when they burn we get &#8216;dirty&#8217; air in the form of haze pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://adsoftheworld.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_retina/public/images/WWFLUNGS.jpg?itok=YuWnXcpm\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Forests &#8216;inhale&#8217; carbon dioxide</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Forests and other plants soak up carbon dioxide, a major driver of climate change and store it away as carbon. Tropical forests alone hold more than 210 gigatons of carbon &#8211; 7 times the amount emitted each year by human activities. &nbsp;The reverse is also true. Deforestation releases more carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere than our entire global transport system &#8211; all the planes, trains and cars put together.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic_co2_deforestation-656x1024.png\" alt=\"infographic_co2_deforestation\" class=\"wp-image-1625\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic_co2_deforestation-656x1024.png 656w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic_co2_deforestation-192x300.png 192w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic_co2_deforestation.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. the missing link in climate action?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, despite the commitments from nations as part of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change we are still headed for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://climate-energy.blogs.panda.org/2016/04/13/increased-forest-ambition-key-meeting-temperature-targets/\">3°C warming</a> and scientists tell us that only an upper limit of<a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/aboutcc/\">1.5&nbsp;°C</a>&nbsp;will save us from the worst effects of climate change &#8211; sea level rises, coral bleaching, droughts, heatwaves. The Paris Agreement recognises that forest can play a huge part in filling that emissions gap because properly protected and managed forests efficiently capture greenhouse gases like CO2.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. home for wildlife</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A square kilometre of forest can be home to more than a 1000 species and is crucial for the conservation of wildlife, &nbsp;like the orangutan and tiger. In <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/sumatra/\">Sumatra</a> 55% of the forest has already been cleared, mostly to make way for agricultural plantation to grow things we consume. If the Sumatran tiger and other critically endangered species are to &nbsp;side-step extinction we need to replant forest to provide them with a home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out how you can start growing your own forest in Sumatra <a href=\"http://earthhour.wwf.sg/en/start-your-own-forest/\">here</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-1668 size-full\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Sumatran-tiger-walking.jpg\" alt=\"Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) walking.\" class=\"wp-image-1668\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Sumatran-tiger-walking.jpg 800w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Sumatran-tiger-walking-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption>Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) walking.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Forests give us FREE SERVICES</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>300 million people worldwide live in forest &#8211;<a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/habitats/forest-habitat\"> 1.6 billion</a> people depend on forests for their livelihoods. Forests play a role in all our lives, providing us with many of the essentials we use everyday &#8211; tissue, paper, furniture. Plus there are the free ecosystem services like protecting our watersheds, and enriching soil. And let&#8217;s not forget the enjoyment forests give to those of us lucky enough to live near one &#8211; a value can&#8217;t be placed on the experience of spending time inside a beautiful, shady forest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>What can you do?</h5>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Find out how you can plant a tree in Sumatra&#8217;s Aceh Province <a href=\"http://earthhour.wwf.sg/en/eh-forest-wwf/\">here</a></li><li>Start growing your own forest <a href=\"http://earthhour.wwf.sg/en/start-your-own-forest/\">here&nbsp;</a></li></ul>\n","date":"2016-05-05T10:34:07","modified":"2018-10-22 23:39:39","featuredImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hazeblog4.jpg","uri":"hazy-issue-can-individuals-help/hazeblog4/","altText":""}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxNjUy","databaseId":1652,"uri":"forests-stop-burning-start-planting/","postId":1652,"title":"Forests: 5 reasons to grow one"}}}
