A symbol of hope. A symbol of power in collective action. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418839\">To prove the point, Earth Hour 2019 aims to bring together communities to drive action for nature, highlighting the <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/ocean/2018/11/plastic-pollution-opinion-businesses-pact/\">impact of individual actions</a> on our one and only planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418845\">The three-day festival (March 29-31) features nature-themed experiences that emphasise on the <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/endangered-species/2018/10/endangered-animals-in-singapore/\">rapid loss of nature due to human activities</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418849\">By way of hands-on workshops and family-friendly activities, it brings together thousands in Singapore to be conscious citizens who make <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/sustainable-consumption/2018/10/how-planet-friendly-is-your-favourite-hawker-food/\">sustainable choices</a> on a daily basis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418854\">Fun fact: the physical festival set-up for booths and workshops are not only created from recycled wooden pallets, they will be further reused after the event! To put it simply, the event will be carbon neutral, zero waste and feature <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/plastics-in-nature/2019/01/plastic-straw-business-owner-pact-wwf/\">sustainable solutions</a> for large-scale events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418859\">But if all of these still sound heavy, we get you. Which is why we came up with a non-exhaustive list of 10 cool reasons why you have to pencil down Earth Hour 2019 in your calendar, stat:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"editorskit-427101418870\"><strong>#1\nImmerse yourself in a multi-sensorial maze</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418874\"><em>Eye\nopening.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418879\">Biodiversity on Earth has declined 60% over the last 40 years to rampant poaching, overfishing, deforestation and more. Travel through the passage of time in this experiential maze featuring three habitats: forest, ocean and frozen world – and find out how we are, too, the solution to the problems we created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418883\">The best part: The maze is made from recycled or recyclable materials. Materials like used textile and recycled pipes are repurposed to create the ‘forest’ and ‘ocean’ zones in the maze. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"editorskit-427101418889\"><strong>#2\nAppreciate food options that are healthy for you and the planet </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418895\"><em>Instant mood lifter.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image editorskit-427101418900\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GHS_Beyond-Sausage_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4218\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GHS_Beyond-Sausage_1.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GHS_Beyond-Sausage_1-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>The Beyond Sausage Food Truck will be serving plant-based sausages sandwiched in soft, homemade vegan bun.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418905\">The food we eat daily can put a strain on our planet. Meat, in fact, is one of the biggest driver of deforestation that contributes to the rapid loss of nature. In celebration of Earth Hour, Bread Street Kitchen will be serving a special Earth Hour menu with selection of plant-based and sustainable items including the Impossible BSK burger, sustainable fish and chips and the watermelon salad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"editorskit-427101418914\"><strong>#3 Get moving to Liv Lo&#8217;s sell-out yoga class</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418920\"><em>#FitSphere</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image editorskit-427101418928\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/181109_Liv-Lo-Profile_0003.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4274\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/181109_Liv-Lo-Profile_0003.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/181109_Liv-Lo-Profile_0003-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/181109_Liv-Lo-Profile_0003-683x1024.jpg 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>Panda Ambassador Liv Lo will be conducting a HIIT yoga class on March 30.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-427101418935\">Founder of <strong>FitSphere, Liv Lo</strong> will be conducting a HIIT yoga class on Saturday morning, 10am.

We work with local manufacturing facility <strong>Xcel Industrial Supplies</strong> and design company <strong>Triple Eyelid</strong> to create booths, workshop spaces and chill-out corners that can be further re-used for more events. To ensure a zero-waste festival, bring your own reusable items or rent them from <strong>Revolv</strong> and <strong>Shinpuru</strong>! Plus, we are addressing food waste with <strong>Citizen Farm</strong> who will be converting them to fertilisers after the event! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"editorskit-42710141948\"><strong>#9\nUpcycle your belongings in a meaningful way</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42710141952\"><em>Build\na circular economy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42710141957\">If you haven’t Kondo-ed everything in your house (see <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/sustainable-consumption/2019/01/marie-kondo-declutter-our-planet-wwf/\">why our planet needs Marie Kondo</a>), this is the perfect opportunity to donate your old goods with a purpose. After you have compiled clothes that no longer “spark joy”, bring them to collection points at any wt+ stores such as <strong>Topshop, Topman, G2000</strong> and more, managed by Wing Tai Retail from 30 March 2019. Garments collected will be sold to be reused in other countries or recycled into industrial cloth.

Luggage collected during the campaign will be donated to Salvation Army to be given a second gift of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"editorskit-42710141964\"><strong>#10\nBe part of a bigger cause than yourself</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42710141968\"><em>Be\nconscious citizens.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42710141976\">Think about what empowerment has done\nfor you. Ever felt that spine-chilling goosebumps when you are cheering for a\nfavourite soccer team in a room full of die-hard fans like yourself? That’s the\nfeeling we get when people with a shared goal come together.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42710141983\">We are working with communities acrossSingapore to come together and drive change for nature in the largest grassroots movement for the planet. <strong>National University of Singapore (NUS)</strong> is opening their school for a night of stargazing, while <strong>Ramada and Days Hotels Singapore</strong>, <strong>Takashimaya Department Store</strong>, <strong>West Coast GRC </strong>and<strong> Changi-Simei CC</strong> will be hosting their own campaign and eco-festival. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-428134632278\"><em><strong>UPDATE: Watch how 40,000 people added their voice to take action for nature at Singapore&#8217;s first zero waste Earth Hour below. </strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio editorskit-428134729955\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Singapore&#039;s first zero-waste Earth Hour\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuiG8alOc7I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42710141988\"><em>For full details and latest updates on Earth Hour 2019, go to </em><a href=\"http://www.wwf.sg/get_involved/earth_hour_2019/\"><em>wwf.sg/earthhour</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42710141992\"><em>Main image: Ryan Everton/ Unsplash.com</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"editorskit-42710141998\"><strong><em>Read more about </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/climate-change/2019/02/environmental-issues-pollution-climate-change/\"><strong><em>why it may be too late if we leave it to the kids to fix the planet</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wildlife/2019/01/new-year-message-wwf-pandas-2019/\"><strong><em>our 2019 wishlist</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/plastics-in-nature/2019/02/sustainable-business-singapore-zoo-pastamania-plastic-reduction/\"><strong><em>Singapore companies who committed to reduce plastic use</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>\n"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MTk5","databaseId":4199,"uri":"earth-hour-2019-singapore-festival-for-nature/","postId":4199,"title":"Why You Can&#8217;t Miss Earth Hour 2019"}}}
