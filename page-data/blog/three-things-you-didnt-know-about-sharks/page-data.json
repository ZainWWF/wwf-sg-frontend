That&#8217;s 25 times more than sharks! Fatal shark attacks are rare. With over 400 species, only a small fraction of them such as White, Bull and Tiger sharks are infamous for unprovoked attacks.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2214\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Original_WW171166.jpg\" alt=\"Original_WW171166\" width=\"4288\" height=\"2848\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Original_WW171166.jpg 4288w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Original_WW171166-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Original_WW171166-1024x680.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4288px) 100vw, 4288px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Overfishing pushes sharks closer to extinction – </strong>Almost 200,000 sharks are killed daily. While some species are targeted for their meat and fins, others are caught as bycatch. This happens when sharks get tangled in fishing gears set for other types of fish like tuna. To make matters worse, most species need a long time to mature. It&#8217;s a process that could take up to 26 years. They also have a low reproduction rate. That&#8217;s why sharks are vulnerable to overfishing.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2215\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0632.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0632\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0632.jpg 5184w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0632-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_0632-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Megalodon is <em>not</em> a myth! –</strong> These monstrous sharks were larger than a bus and used to roam the oceans millions of years ago. They fed on miniature whales to survive and went extinct due to the lack of food. This carries important lessons for us about the importance of protecting the food source of sharks, in order to save them.</p>\n<p>Based on these facts, one thing is clear: sharks are vulnerable marine creatures. If only we could set aside our unfounded fears, we could protect them – and our oceans – better.</p>\n<p>WWF’s Leader for Sharks and Rays Initiative, Dr Andy Cornish, was in town recently  to answer some burning questions about sharks.
