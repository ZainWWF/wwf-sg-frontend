The tranquility of Angkor Wat? The breathtaking beauty of the Grand Canyon? Or, for most Singaporeans, it is probably the exquisite design of our very own Botanic Gardens. In fact, there is a  total of </span><a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1031 UNESCO World Heritage sites</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the globe honoring some of the world’s most spectacular natural and manmade wonders. </span></p>\n<p>Covering approximately 0.5% of the Earth’s surface, natural World Heritage sites benefit the livelihood of nearly 11 million living in or near the sites.  They bring in substantial amount of profit to the local communities through tourism, recreation and the export of resources.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to preserve the heritage for our future generation, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/\">UNESCO </a>calls on both the local and international communities to contribute in the conservation of these sites regardless of territorial boundaries. The reason behind is simple &#8211; any damage, if incurred, could be irreversible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a recent</span> <a href=\"http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/wwf_dalberg_protecting_people_through_nature_lr_singles.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published by WWF concludes that nearly half of the 229 natural World Heritage sites are threatened by harmful industrial activities, </span>despite their protected status<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1630 \" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic-unesco.png\" alt=\"infographic-unesco\" width=\"797\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic-unesco.png 980w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic-unesco-300x148.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px\" /><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1631 \" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic-2.png\" alt=\"infographic 2\" width=\"799\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic-2.png 986w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/infographic-2-300x146.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\" /></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><b>SUMATRA &#8211; RAINFOREST ON FIRE</b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1618 \" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SCR_279140.jpg\" alt=\"Orang utan high in tree of rainforest canopy, (Pongo abelii) Leuser NP, Indonesia\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SCR_279140.jpg 1280w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SCR_279140-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SCR_279140-1024x684.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><span style=\"color: #999999;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra houses some of Southeast Asia’s most precious animal species such as Orangutan</span></i></span></p>\n<p>Consisting of three National Parks, the majestic Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra covers nearly 25 million hectares of land with more than 10,000 plant and animal species including the endemic orangutan, rhino and tiger. It became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004 and was later included in the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2011.</p>\n<p>While Sumatra may seem less of a concern for Singaporeans since it is not situated within our national boundary, here are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">three reasons</span> why it is important and relevant for us to preserve the site:</p>\n<h6>1. IT AFFECTS THEM</h6>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from its importance in conserving the archipelago’s biodiversity, the rainforest is also crucial to the well-being of those who depend on it for food and income. In fact, out of the 11 million whose lives are supported by the natural heritage sites, 6 million are living in or near the rainforest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to increasing demand in palm oil and timber however, poorly-regulated logging and land-clearing practices are causing large-scale deforestation in Sumatra, threatening local residents&#8217; trading way of life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1621 size-full\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sumatra-women.jpg\" alt=\"Talang Mamak people.

The local residents’ trading way of life is threatened by forest clearance for oil palm plantations.</span></i></span></p>\n<h6>2. IT AFFECTS US</h6>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The damage doesn’t just stay within the boundary. Its impact can cross geographical borders and cause regional environmental disasters. The 2015 Southeast Asian Haze, which affected several countries in Southeast Asia including Singapore, was a painful episode.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haze pollution not only threatened our health, but also brought about economic loss to our country. It caused an estimated economic loss of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/haze-episode-cost/2605406.html\">S$700 million</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in Singapore and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was largely a result of the forest fires triggered by the “slash-and-burn” method practiced by unsustainable oil palm and pulp and paper plantations..</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-1622 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Blog-haze.jpg\" alt=\"A general view of a housing estate covered by haze in Singapore. The haze was the result of illegal burning of forests and other land on Sumatra island in Indonesia to make way for palm oil plantations and is causing Singaporeans to experience physical discomfort migraines, burning eyes, rashes, dry throats and runny noses and in cases of weaker individuals, asthma attacks and respiratory issues. Some offices and businesses have even suspended operations, to ensure their employees and customers are not exposed to the hazardous haze.

IT AFFECTS EVERYONE</h6>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deforestation in Sumatra is a global concern.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The clearing of forested area has severely damaged the habitat of critically-endangered animal species, pushing them towards the brink of extinction. As of today, there remains only 7300 <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-orangutan\">Sumatran orangutans</a> and as few as 400 <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-tiger\">Sumatran tigers</a>, all are holding on for survival in forests that are slowly disappearing. The loss of biodiversity affects the <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/biodiversity/biodiversity_and_you/\">interdependent ecosystem</a> as a whole and it should be stopped in order to protect everyone on Earth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deforestation also contributes to climate change. When trees are cut down, the carbon that was previously absorbed and stored by the forests is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. On top of that, large amount of carbon dioxide is generated from the burning of trees, releasing even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are one of the leading culprits of climate change and up to a fifth of global emissions come from deforestation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1695 \" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blog-deforestation.jpg\" alt=\"Illegal logging for paper industry and forest clearing for Palm oil plantation.
