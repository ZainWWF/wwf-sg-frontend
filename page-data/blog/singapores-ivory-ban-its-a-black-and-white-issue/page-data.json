This was followed quickly by surprise and even shock. <em>Isn’t ivory already banned? Why is Singapore only banning ivory now?</em></p>\n<p>As the&nbsp;Conservation Resource Manager at WWF-Singapore, I&#8217;ve been “tusked” with answering your burning questions!</p>\n<p><strong>Why is Singapore only banning ivory now? Hasn’t there always been a ban?</strong><br />\nYou’re not wrong to be confused, folks! Here’s the deal: It has been illegal since 1990 for countries to buy and sell ivory. However, ivory that entered the market before 1990 are still permitted for sale – even here in Singapore.<br />\nSome of you might have seen ivory products being sold and reported these instances to us, but they are not illegal if these specimens are proven to date back before 1990 international trade ban.</p>\n<p><strong>Are people still buying ivory in Singapore? WHY?</strong><br />\nLet’s just say that in Singapore, ivory has gone the way of shoulder pads and mullets – and hopefully stays there.<br />\nDemand for ivory has been on on the decline here in Singapore at least for the last almost 20 years. A <a href=\"http://www.traffic.org/home/2013/11/8/falling-demand-for-ivory-in-cambodia-and-singapore.html\">TRAFFIC survey</a> in 2013 found that the number of retail outlets openly selling ivory products have declined significantly. Many retailers today are having trouble finding buyers for their stock.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Already excited about this ban?

Perceptions of luxury have outweighed concerns for wildlife. Global demand for ivory remains high today. One African elephant is killed every 25 minutes by poachers! In terms of size, the biggest consumer markets for ivory today are China, the US, followed by Hong Kong. According to wildlife trade experts, ivory is also being stockpiled speculatively.</p>\n<p><strong>How will domestic ivory bans &#8211; such as the one we hope to have in Singapore &#8211; help save elephants?</strong><br />\nIt is difficult to tell the true age of an ivory product just by looking it. Banning the sale of all ivory &#8211; including pre-1990 stock &#8211; helps to remove the opportunity for traders to pass off newly poached ivory for vintage stock.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2130\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IvoryBan2-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IvoryBan2-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IvoryBan2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IvoryBan2.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>How does Singapore compare with other countries when it comes to an ivory ban?</strong><br />\nWith a ban in place, we will join others like China, the US and Hong Kong in sending a strong signal to the world that there is no longer a market for ivory.<br />\nChina will ban all local sales of ivory by the end of this year, and Hong Kong will do so by 2021. A near-total ban took place in the US as of last year. Next, Europe. Pressure is now building up on the European countries to announce similar bans.</p>\n<p><strong>Want to see ivory gone for good in Singapore? Here are the questions you should be asking&#8230;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>How will the Singapore government implement this ban, and what’s the time frame?</li>\n<li>Will sellers of ivory need to surrender their stocks?</li>\n<li>What will the government do with these ivory stocks and will an audit be conducted?</li>\n<li>Are there any exceptions to the ban? For example, with musical instruments, museum exchanges etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With your help, we can make Singapore’s ivory trade a thing of the past.
