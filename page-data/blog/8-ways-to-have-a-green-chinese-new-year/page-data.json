Am I right, my fellow unwed friends? But it has been reported that <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1401517/red-envelope-tradition-lunar-new-year-kills-16000-trees-year-says\" target=\"_blank\">more than 16,000 trees are used yearly to make red packets in Hong Kong</a> alone &#8211; only to be thrown away seconds after the “goods” have been taken out.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2071\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2071\" style=\"width: 2448px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2071\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/angpao.jpg\" alt=\"Use slot-in red packets instead of glue-on ones. \" width=\"2448\" height=\"2412\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/angpao.jpg 2448w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/angpao-300x296.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/angpao-1024x1009.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2448px) 100vw, 2448px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Use slot-in red packets instead of glue-on ones.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Unfortunately, red packets made from recycled or FSC-certified paper is not commonly available in Singapore.</p>\n<p>A simple way to ensure that you are still a festive eco-hero is to choose slot-in instead of glue-on red packets. By choosing to use only slot-ins, you are allowing the receiver to reuse the red packets and this in-turn reduces the total amount of paper produced for red packets!</p>\n<p><strong>2) Low carbon footprint visiting</strong></p>\n<p>House visits are an essential part of the Chinese New Year, and strategic transport planning is definitely needed amidst the hustle and bustle of the festivities.</p>\n<p>The solution to fast transportation? Car rides. But do you know that a typical passenger vehicle produces the same annual energy use of 422,542 homes?</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2074 size-full\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shihuis-pic.jpg\" alt=\"Cars\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shihuis-pic.jpg 1200w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shihuis-pic-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shihuis-pic-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shihuis-pic-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2074\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keep Singapore&#8217;s carbon footprint low by booking a Maxicab instead of two standard cabs.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A great way to move around quickly is to maximise your carpool! If you are thinking of getting taxis to make your rounds, choose to <a href=\"http://www.mymaxi.sg/\" target=\"_blank\">book a Maxicab</a> instead of two standard taxis. You can not only reduce the carbon footprint but also save lots of money from your separate booking fees.</p>\n<p>Or better yet, take the public transport! Plan your route using Google Maps and add your destinations to your calendar. That way you can maximise the number of houses to visit and save us from additional carbon footprint.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Use glass jars for goodies</strong></p>\n<p>Just thinking about pineapple tarts and love letters makes my mouth water. But as we all know, these highly addictive treats are usually sold in plastic containers. So if you are baking this Chinese New Year, drop the plastic and keep your treats in mason jars instead!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2075\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2075\" style=\"width: 960px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2075 size-full\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mason-jar.jpg\" alt=\"Mason jar\" width=\"960\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mason-jar.jpg 960w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mason-jar-300x198.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2075\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keep your CNY goodies in reusable mason jars instead of plastic containers.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>What I do is that I let my goodies out to cool after baking, and then place them neatly in my mason jar. These jars are not only environmentally friendly; they also keep your goodies fresh for as long as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Donate the clothes you have outgrown</strong></p>\n<p>Chinese New Year also calls for some spring cleaning. More often than not, we tend to discard clothes that we have either outgrown or do not like anymore. What to do with them then? Donate it!</p>\n<p>Here is a list of organisations consolidated by Honeykids that tells you where you can <a href=\"http://honeykidsasia.com/charity-singapore-donation/\" target=\"_blank\">drop off your clothes</a>.</p>\n<p>Donation is a great idea but just make sure your clothes are not torn and tattered, because after all, you are giving your clothes to someone, not your trash.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2076\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2076\" style=\"width: 960px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2076\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jeans-428613_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"Trade-in your old jeans for a voucher while knowing that they will be put to great use!\" width=\"960\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jeans-428613_960_720.jpg 960w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jeans-428613_960_720-300x198.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2076\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trade-in your old jeans for a voucher while knowing that they will be put to great use!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An alternative is to trade-in your clothes. For instance, Levi’s is holding a campaign to <a href=\"http://www.tampinesmall.com.sg/en/deals/tenants.sg.tampines-mall.levis---trade-in-jeans-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\">trade-in your old jeans</a> in exchange for a S$50 voucher. The old jeans will then be collected and donated to their charity partners.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Eat sustainably</strong></p>\n<p>Chinese New Year basically screams “Food!” and “MORE FOOD!”. Especially seafood since the Chinese word for “fish” (鱼 Yú /yoo/) sounds like &#8216;surplus&#8217; &#8211; which is always good as it is a sign that they can make more next year.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2077\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2077\" style=\"width: 995px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2077\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Steamed-Fish-2.jpg\" alt=\"#KnowYourSeafood and check the WWF-Singapore Seafood Guide before doing your grocery shopping!\" width=\"995\" height=\"554\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Steamed-Fish-2.jpg 995w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Steamed-Fish-2-300x167.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2077\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">#KnowYourSeafood and check the WWF-Singapore Seafood Guide before doing your grocery shopping!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But do you know if what you are eating is sustainable? #KnowYourSeafood and check the type of seafood you are getting before you buy it by downloading <a href=\"http://wwf.sg/seafoodguide\" target=\"_blank\">WWF-Singapore’s Seafood Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can also watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/earthhoursg?sub_confirmation=1\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube cookery series</a> presented by WWF-Singapore and learn the types of seafood you can replace with to have a more sustainable Chinese New Year!</p>\n<p><strong>6) Support green F&amp;B products</strong></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2078\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2078\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2078\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Palm-oil-3.jpg\" alt=\"Choose F&amp;B products that use sustainable palm oil.\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Palm-oil-3.jpg 800w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Palm-oil-3-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2078\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Choose F&amp;B products that use sustainable palm oil.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another great way to make sure that you are consuming sustainably is to support F&amp;B brands that care about the environment as much as you do.</p>\n<p>We have published a list of companies that choose to use sustainable palm oil in their products.

Let’s not be part of this statistic, and only cook what you can consume.</p>\n<p>While you do your grocery shopping, do not forget to only get what you need so as to not let any food go to waste!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2081\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2081\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2081\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dog-trash.jpg\" alt=\"Only cook what you can consume and not contribute to food waste.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dog-trash.jpg 2000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dog-trash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dog-trash-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2081\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Only cook what you can consume and not contribute to food waste.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now go gobble down those goodies, grab all the red packets and have the most prosperous Chinese New Year! <em>HUAT AH!</em></p>\n"}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMDY3","databaseId":2067,"uri":"8-ways-to-have-a-green-chinese-new-year/","postId":2067,"title":"8 Ways to Have a Green Chinese New Year"}}}
