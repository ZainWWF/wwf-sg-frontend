And 82% think a shark fin alternative (like double-boiled soup) at a banquet is acceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The breakthrough came last year when 89 Singapore-based establishments including local favourites foodpanda, Crystal Jade and more came together to pledge against having shark&#8217;s fin in their menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s been a full year since we&#8217;ve announced the significant commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The question is: How&nbsp;are&nbsp;they&nbsp;doing?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For food delivery service foodpanda, they simply removed the dish from their restaurants; not replacing the dish with other fish or meat substances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head of Marketing for foodpanda Laura Kantor revealed that since removing shark&#8217;s fin from all their restaurants by March 2018, the number of restaurant partners on the food-delivery platform has doubled to 6,000. They have also been working closely with the restaurants to ensure that shark fin hasn&#8217;t been added to their menus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kantor also added, &#8220;So far, we have had nothing but positive feedback from our customers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some restaurants have also taken this opportunity to experiment with other alternatives to replace the iconic traditional Chinese dish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since we’ve phased out shark’s fin from our menus, our chefs have introduced creative new dishes that traditionally uses shark’s fin as a main ingredient, and they have been well-received. For example, for the upcoming Chinese New Year, bird’s nest and peach resin are used to craft festive dishes such as&nbsp;<em>Braised Bird’s Nest with Crab Meat &amp; Conpoy</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Double-boiled&nbsp;Sea whelk Soup with Chicken &amp; Peach Resin,&#8221;&nbsp;</em>a&nbsp;spokesperson&nbsp;from&nbsp;Crystal&nbsp;Jade&nbsp;shared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The younger and environmentally-conscious customers are definitely more appreciative and supportive that we have taken this step forward and our regular customers are also very receptive to this change especially since we have other noteworthy dish recommendations for them&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In partnership with WWF, this is part of the Hilton Hotels&#8217; global responsible sourcing strategy towards a longer and larger commitment towards sustainable seafood. They have banned shark&#8217;s fin since 2014. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/OUR-2018-ROUND-UP-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4105\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/OUR-2018-ROUND-UP-11.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/OUR-2018-ROUND-UP-11-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>Executive Chef Ku Keung has had 20 years of culinary experience under his belt, and joined Conrad Centennial Singapore in 2005.<br><em>© Conrad Centennial Singapore (left); © WWF-Hong Kong / Tracy Tsang (right)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly for Executive Chef Ku Keung who leads the Chinese fine dining restaurant Golden Peony in popular local wedding venue Conrad Centennial Singapore, he found purpose in being creative by cooking with other substances and techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Traditionally, shark&#8217;s fin soup is always prepared in a particular manner. However, by no longer serving shark fin, it has opened the opportunity for our chefs to cook up more meaningful and delicious dishes using different ingredients and cooking methods.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other premium ingredients such as lobster and bird&#8217;s nest have been used in replacement of shark&#8217;s fin. In an attempt to tease the tastebuds of the diners, the hotel has created a special duck dish paired with special plum sauce for their wedding menu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their Chinese New Year dishes include the peach resin with red date broth and dessert, soya pudding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, Ramada and Days Hotels&#8217; commitment to remove shark fin from their menus started way back in 2014 when they first opened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Working alongside WWF, we have garnered great awareness and customer’s support towards this initiative. Our culinary team has substituted shark fin with other premium ingredients such as bird nest, fish maw, conpoy and abalone.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have also received numerous positive feedback from customers complementing the nature of this initiative and our support towards sharks protection and against shark finning. Our&nbsp;pledge not to consume shark&#8217;s fin dishes and to educate the public about the environmental damage caused by the shark&#8217;s fin trade are part of the nationwide and global campaign.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, local food delivery service Deliveroo has also committed to removing 150 shark fin dishes from 34 restaurants in its platform, in a public announcement released on Nov 28, 2018.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This initiative brings the best out of everyone. It has challenged us to seek and use more sustainable ingredients, explore new ways to engage and delight our diners as well positively contributing to the environment.&#8221; explained Chef Ku Keung.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Say no to shark fin this Chinese New Year </em><a href=\"http://www.wwf.sg/get_involved/say_no_shark_fin/\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more about how </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/plastics-in-nature/2019/01/plastic-straw-business-owner-pact-wwf/\"><strong><em>business owners can reduce plastic usage</em></strong></a><strong><em>, how this hero could </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/ocean/2019/01/marine-animals-palawan-philippines-wwf/\"><strong><em>protect more than a million hectares of marine protected area in Palawan</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and </em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wildlife/2019/01/new-year-message-wwf-pandas-2019/\"><strong><em>8 things on every panda&#8217;s wish list this year</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>\n","uri":"shark-fish-fin-chinese-new-year-restaurants/","author":{"name":"Sharon Salim","slug":"ssalim","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e36b8ae309f36dfc7c9fe446f89fd97d?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"chinese new year menu","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/chinese-new-year-menu/"},{"name":"conrad centennial","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/conrad-centennial/"},{"name":"crystal jade","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/crystal-jade/"},{"name":"food panda","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/food-panda/"},{"name":"no shark fin","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/no-shark-fin/"},{"name":"ramada and days hotels","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/tag/ramada-and-days-hotels/"}]},"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Shark Fin","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/shark-fin/"},{"name":"Sustainable Consumption","link":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/category/sustainable-consumption/"}]}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDo0MDQ3","uri":"shark-fish-fin-chinese-new-year-restaurants/","title":"No Shark Fin in CNY Menu?
