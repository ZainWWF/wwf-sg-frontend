Wait, how much do you know about them?</span></p>\n<p><strong>1) Its name means “something that rolls up”</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2094\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wildafricaconservationfund-dot-org.jpg\" alt=\"wildafricaconservationfund-dot-org\" width=\"1700\" height=\"1132\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wildafricaconservationfund-dot-org.jpg 1700w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wildafricaconservationfund-dot-org-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wildafricaconservationfund-dot-org-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pangolins roll up into a ball when they are threatened. So, it is no surprise that the word “pangolin”, which originates from the Malay word &#8220;pengguling&#8221;, literally means “something that rolls up”! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not underestimate at their ability to protect themselves though. Their body armour is so hard, even big cats like tigers have difficulty biting through their scales! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2) They are the most trafficked animal in the world.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2095 size-full\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin2.jpg\" alt=\"B8C8GY CAPE PANGOLIN\" width=\"5157\" height=\"3343\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin2.jpg 5157w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin2-1024x664.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5157px) 100vw, 5157px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might be hard to believe, but one pangolin is snatched from the wild every five minutes. The primary threat to pangolins in Asia, and increasingly in Africa, is illegal hunting and poaching for illicit international trade, which is driven by market demand in East Asia. Over a million pangolins are estimated to have been illegally traded in the last 10 years for use in traditional Chinese medicine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Illegal pangolin trade takes place everywhere! This even includes social media channels like Facebook. The negotiations can take place entirely online, and the traders and buyers do not even meet.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3) A pangolin’s tongue can be longer than its body.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2096\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin5.jpg\" alt=\"pangolin5\" width=\"735\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin5.jpg 735w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin5-300x245.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pangolins have no teeth. They ‘chew’ with gravel and keratinous spines located inside the stomach. As they eat ants, they also swallow small rocks that smash against the ants to digest their food! Well, they definitely need a little bit of help from the 70 million ants they consume per year right?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4) Pangolins are now protected from all international trade.</strong></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2097\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2097\" style=\"width: 3880px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2097\" src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin1.jpg\" alt=\"Manis tetradactyla Long-tailed pangolin Heavily hunted despite legal protection Minkébé National Park, Gabon\" width=\"3880\" height=\"2437\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin1.jpg 3880w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin1-300x188.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin1-1024x643.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3880px) 100vw, 3880px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Manis tetradactyla Long-tailed pangolin Heavily hunted despite legal protection Minkébé National Park, Gabon</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As of last year, countries at CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna) have agreed to list all eight species of pangolins (four Asian and four African) to Appendix I. This means that pangolins get full protection against international trade.

The Sunda Pangolin can still be found in our forests. However with increased development pushing into our forests, they are increasingly threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>\n<p>To celebrate this shy creature, you can head down to ArtScience Museum to see them in virtual-action at the Into The Wild exhibition! Admission is free for all so don’t say <em>bojio</em>.</p>\n","date":"2017-02-18T08:00:33","modified":"2017-02-18 12:30:52","featuredImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pangolin2.jpg","uri":"5-things-you-didnt-know-about-pangolins/b8c8gy/","altText":""}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMDkz","databaseId":2093,"uri":"5-things-you-didnt-know-about-pangolins/","postId":2093,"title":"5 Things You Didn’t Know About Pangolins"}}}
