This area had been, after all, their home for 10,000 years. Also, they were just hungry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearing of forests had removed food and water sources for the elephants, rendering it impossible for the herds to stay put. When they saw that their new neighbours were stocked with an abundance of crops, desperation for food and water kicked in.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It walked right through the village,&#8221; a villager described. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Stealing the crops is not a big problem, but stomping on them is. That causes the damage,&#8221; another explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picture1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5113\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picture1.png 893w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picture1-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" /><figcaption>A herd of wild elephants foraging for food in a rubber plantation.<br><em>©WWF-Thailand</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also seemed perfectly reasonable for the local farmers to feel threatened. For local communities, the plantation areas were a source of forest products, rubber, rice and other crops. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN2814.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5164\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN2814.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN2814-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>Farmers depend on the crops for livelihood.<br><em>©WWF-Thailand</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In early 2016, a herd of hungry and thirsty elephants left the forest and raided crops in Chumphon, alarming residents in the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tension has continued to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have no idea how the government will help us solve the problem,&#8221; a monk told us.

This is believed to be the leading cause of elephant deaths in Asia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Greater Mekong region, poisons, guns and snares are commonly employed to bring down the elephants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year, 40-50 elephants and about 100 humans are killed during crop-raiding in India.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/elephant_AP43144154588.jpg?fit=975%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5127\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/elephant_AP43144154588.jpg 2500w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/elephant_AP43144154588-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/elephant_AP43144154588-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\" /><figcaption>About 129 critically endangered elephants have died in Sumatra, Indonesia from poisoning or shooting in less than a decade.<br><em>©</em><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/indonesia-critically-endangered-sumatran-elephants-poisoned-shot-wwf-says/\"><em>cbsnews.com</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the wild elephants had a voice, we would hear an emotional plea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are just 3,700 wild Asian elephants left in Thailand.

With advance notice, livelihoods and lives &#8211; both human and elephant &#8211; can be saved.  The decision was made to purchase six GPS collars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As part of our research on studying the behaviour of wild elephants, we can now track elephant movement patterns when they come out of the Eastern Forest Complex to the village,&#8221; said Dr Supagit Vinitpornsawan, Head of Dong Phayayen &#8211; Khao Yai Wildlife Research Station. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN0447-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5171\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN0447-2.jpg 1000w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ARN0447-2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>&#8220;Another reason to implement this project is to try and reduce the human-elephant conflict.

The research team had been practising for more than a month to collar an elephant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a misty morning, which proved to be risky for the team to approach the elephant with blurred vision. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.23.57.png?fit=975%2C497&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5120\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.23.57.png 1235w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.23.57-300x153.png 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.23.57-1024x522.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px\" /><figcaption>Morning of the collaring day.<br><em>©WWF-Thailand</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the skies cleared within half an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team had received information that the leader of an elephant herd had been crossing the same road for over two weeks. The herd of elephants would leave the forest in the evening to look for food and return in the early morning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waiting in position, the team finally spotted the elephant targeted for collaring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.30.02.png?fit=975%2C496&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5121\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.30.02.png 1243w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.30.02-300x153.png 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.30.02-1024x521.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1243px) 100vw, 1243px\" /><figcaption>The leader of the herd of elephants.<br><em>©WWF-Thailand</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once tranquillised, the task of collaring the targeted elephant had to be carried out swiftly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sedatives would wear off after an hour. During this step, the elephant doctor also collected DNA, which would help to identify the collared elephant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything was done in 10 minutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.39.29.png?fit=975%2C501&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5122\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.39.29.png 1225w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.39.29-300x154.png 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-07-at-12.39.29-1024x526.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1225px) 100vw, 1225px\" /><figcaption>The moment the research team was waiting for: a &#8220;connected&#8221; signal satellite collar to appear on the screen, marked by a red dot, to track the elephant&#8217;s real-time position. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaring done, we now knew the exact whereabouts of the herd. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every step recorded and monitored will provide valuable intel about the direction, distance travelled, walking speed &#8211; even the elephants&#8217; eating and drinking patterns.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the job is far from done, collaring and tracking elephants brings hope for the peace that once prevailed in the 250,000 hectares of pristine forest of the Eastern Forest Complex. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forests continue to fall to human encroachment all over Southeast Asia.
