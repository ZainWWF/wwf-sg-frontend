Of which some were repeatedly burnt.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHOTO-2019-08-13-14-55-58_1-3-1024x752.jpg\" alt=\"forest fire\" class=\"wp-image-5234\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHOTO-2019-08-13-14-55-58_1-3-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHOTO-2019-08-13-14-55-58_1-3-300x220.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHOTO-2019-08-13-14-55-58_1-3.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>200 hectares comprising a mix of acacia plantation and secondary forest areas were burnt.&nbsp;<br><em>Zulfahmi/ WWF-Indonesia</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick check-in with our colleagues in Indonesia revealed that the cause of the fire was still unknown.

This was 500 metres away from the camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formed with rescued elephants from conflict areas, Tesso Nilo Flying Elephant Squad (FES) was set up by WWF and the Conservation Authority of Riau to <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wildlife/2019/08/asian-elephant-thai-farmers-conflict/\">reduce human-elephant conflict</a>. WWF had also started the <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wildlife/2019/06/borneo-orangutan-bukit-piton-restored-forest/\">forest restoration initiative</a> which was essential in eliminating illegal logging practices and forest fires to protect the natural habitat of Asian elephants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eight elephants in the squad and their mahouts patrol the settlement areas on the edges of the national park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a timeline of events:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>9 AUGUST</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fire was detected in the afternoon.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.wwf.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHOTO-2019-08-13-14-55-58-1.jpg?fit=975%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5235\" srcset=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHOTO-2019-08-13-14-55-58-1.jpg 1080w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHOTO-2019-08-13-14-55-58-1-300x215.jpg 300w, https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHOTO-2019-08-13-14-55-58-1-1024x735.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /><figcaption>Together with the Tesso Nilo National Park personnel, WWF was working with the government and sub-district police to put out the fire with the available tools and resources.&nbsp;<br>©<em>Zulfahmi/ WWF-Indonesia</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the fire was spreading quickly.

This was near the burnt area, and precautionary actions were taken immediately to prevent activities that could potentially trigger new fires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>19 AUGUST</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire recurred in several spots again. A joint team including WWF tried to extinguish the fire. Up to this point, efforts to put out the fire are still ongoing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>20 &#8211; 21 AUGUST</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A health examination for the elephants was arranged. Initial plans to send those involved in the fire-fighting operations to undergo a medical check-up were postponed to next week as the team needed to focus on putting out the fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the number of hotspots has been significantly reduced, our work is far from over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stepping up on intensive monitoring work in the following weeks is critical due to the extremely dry season and human activities inside and around the national park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Tesso Nilo is currently home to iconic Sumatran wildlife with an estimated 113 to 180 wild Asian elephants and <a href=\"https://dev-wwfsg.pantheonsite.io/wildlife/2019/02/rare-sumatran-tiger-found-near-a-human-settlement-what-does-it-mean/\">two Sumatran tigers</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need immediate assistance and more support to protect and restore the burnt forest areas and ensure that we stop the decline of wildlife populations in this precious habitat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Meet the firefighters of Riau\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LuPBDzMVCM4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Every support counts.
